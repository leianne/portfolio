              Coding has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember.
              The process of taking an idea, and transforming it into a real
              product always excites me. I am lucky to have been taught by some
              of the most passionate and considerate developers at Lambda School
              and have taken the skills that I have learned and am gaining every
              day to build projects that I am passionate about.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to create software that will impact many, it is a
              passion of mine to help others in need and I feel as though there
              are so many ways this can be done through technology.
